Version 0.4
===========
+ License changed to GPL (v3) to comply with terms of the GPL for use of PyBluez.
+ Fixed memory leak issues on Mac OS X when deallocating objects created with pyobjc.
+ Fixed finddevices() on Mac OS X to not thrown an exception if no devices are found.


Version 0.3.3
=============
+ Deprecation warnings no longer appear for Mac OS 10.5.
+ Fixed sockets to raise socket.timeout correctly.
+ Fixed bugs in connect() & disconnect() in OBEXClient for both Mac & Linux.
+ Fixed OBEX transfer speed for OBEXClient on Linux.


Version 0.3.2
=============
+ Fixed so doesn't raise exception when using 'from lightblue import *'.
+ For Linux: fixed bug where lightblue.obex.recvfile() was often refusing requests.
+ For Mac: fixed bug where NSInconsistencyException was being raised while blocking/processing events.


Version 0.3.1
=============
+ This fixes a bug in findservices() on Python for Series 60.


Version 0.3
===========
+ A new OBEXClient class for Mac OS X and Linux. It can send all the usual OBEX requests, with any type of headers (including custom headers). There is a new obex_ftp_client.py example that uses OBEXClient to implement an OBEX File Transfer client.
+ The library now works on Mac OS 10.5. Currently there are some deprecation warnings when you import lightblue, but there shouldn't be any issues otherwise.
+ The BTUtil framework has been renamed to "LightAquaBlue", and its OBEX-related classes have been completely rewritten; it now has a much better, more flexible API, that makes it possible to use it to build higher-level OBEX implementations.
+ The Linux version's internal OBEX code has been completely rewritten, and it's now much easier to customise and tweak the OBEX client and server implementations, if necessary.
+ The lightblue.obex sendfile() and recvfile() functions now accept any old file-like objects, instead of only accepting built-in file objects with proper file descriptors.
+ Fixed various unicode-related bugs.


Version 0.2.3
=============
+ Fixed Linux version to work with newer versions of PyBluez


Version 0.2.2
=============
+ The PyS60 3rd Edition binaries have (really) been fixed, and gethostaddr() and gethostclass() should also be fixed for PyS60 2nd Edition FP2 and FP3.
+ Since it's getting more difficult to build for PyS60 1st Edition, this build has been dropped for this version -- which isn't an issue for this release since there are no new features -- but there won't be any further builds for this edition. If you need to compile LightBlue for 1st Edition, feel free to email me with any issues.
+ Fixed functions on Mac OS X build that wait (e.g. finddevices(), recv() for sockets) so that they don't busy-wait and hog the CPU.


Version 0.2.1
=============
+ Hopefully fixed problems with PyS60 3rd Edition sisx binary
+ Added unsigned sis for PyS60 3rd Edition with maximum free dev cert capabilities


Version 0.2
===========

+ L2CAP client sockets for Mac OS X and Linux
+ finddevicename() now takes usecache argument to specify whether to do a remote name request if name is in local cache
+ stopadvertising() is now automatically called for a socket when close() is called on the socket
+ Added SIS build for Series 60 3rd Edition
+ If some of the SIS files for PyS60 didn't work before, they should now
+ Improved buffering of received data for sockets on Mac OS X
+ Fixed recv() for mac sockets if other side has closed connection
+ Fixed mac sockets to receive binary data
