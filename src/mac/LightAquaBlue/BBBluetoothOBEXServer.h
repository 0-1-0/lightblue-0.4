//  BBBluetoothOBEXServer.h
//  LightAquaBlue
//
//  Implements the server side of an OBEX session over a Bluetooth transport.
//
//  Generally you will use BBBluetoothOBEXServer like this:
//    1. Call registerForChannelOpenNotifications:selector:withChannelID:direction:
//       in the IOBluetoothRFCOMMChannel class in order be notified whenever 
//       you receive a client connection on a particular RFCOMM channel ID.
//    2. When you are notified that a client has connected, use the provided
//       IOBluetoothRFCOMMChannel to create a a BBBluetoothOBEXServer
//       object, and then call run: on the object to start the server.
//
//  There is an example in examples/LightAquaBlue/SimpleOBEXServer that shows
//  how to use this class to run a basic OBEX server session.  
//
